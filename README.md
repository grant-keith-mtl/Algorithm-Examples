# Algorithm-Examples

This is a repo that I am using as I go through Intro To Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein

I am going to go through all of the algorithms and topics in this book and come up with examples and explanations for each of them.

I will do this initially in Javascript, but will recreate each of them as I continue to learn more programming languages.
